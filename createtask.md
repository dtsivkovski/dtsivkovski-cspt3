# Create Performance Task

### Plan
My plan is to have a shopping cart/price calculator that takes user input for items, finds it from a list, and then uses that information to calculate the total. This total would also be checked to see if a discount or voucher is applicable and inform the user.

### Code Snippets
No code snippets available currently.

### Runtime
No runtime available as of right now.
