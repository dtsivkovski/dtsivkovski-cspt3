### AP Exam Week 1
- Collegeboard AP Practice Quiz 5 - 48/50
- Corrections:
  - Q9: Sorting data takes the most time when an increase of users happens, as it increases 100-fold as opposed to the 10-fold that I had picked.
  - Q16: Program A and B actually display the same values in the same order. I thought they displayed different values.
